    <p class="intro">Mojo is a simple way to recognise people who make things better — quietly, kindly, and without fuss.</p>

    <p>Whether it’s a waiter who remembered your name, a nurse who stayed a little longer, or a mechanic who explained things clearly — Mojo helps you say thanks in a way that gets noticed, not lost.</p>

    <p>It’s not about ratings or reviews. It’s about moments, gratitude, and giving people a boost.</p>

    <p>Mojo is designed for hospitality, healthcare, retail — anywhere people make a difference. Just scan a tag, leave a kind word, and we’ll pass it on.</p>

    <p>Built and hosted in Australia, Mojo was created with a single goal: <strong>to make sharing appreciation easy — and feel good doing it.</strong></p>

    <p>If you'd like to use Mojo at your venue, or just want to know more, <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
